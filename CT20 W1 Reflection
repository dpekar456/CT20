this week we started p5.js, initially it was kind of difficult to learn because I didn't have an end goal on what I wanted to see out of this coding. I created a triangle and a circle but from there I didn't really have a direction to take it to. I decided to reset and test some beginning ideas for the clock assignment. I currently have the idea of a sundial or a clock in an office but I dont really have a fun twist for that part, I just want something unusual in a very usual setting.
