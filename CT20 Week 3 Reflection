I have decided to revamp my code. I kept running into the same like 3 walls with my code so I am
resetting my work, I'm looking more into the basics of coding so that I can more strategically
create my code. I've also somewhat changed my idea, I still want a pinwheel that can spin but 
maybe something closer to conventional clock in that it does spin but it spins backwards with the 
color changing based on the seconds passed. here's a link to my work in progress https://editor.p5js.org/dpekar/sketches/qMMq7xI0z
