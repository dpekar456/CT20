Ok so my idea has shifted to a circus pinwheel. Currently I'm stuck on my background, i've tried some of the fixes and I think im following
the code rules correctly but maybe my format doesn't allow inputting an image as the background? I've tried placing the image on the draw function but then 
I run into the issue of when I *almost* rotated the cylinder and part of it gets cut off by my image. another thing I'm attempting to do is limit the rotate ability to just 
spinning the wheel by itself, I'm using the correct axis to limit spin however it is not allowing any movement. I think I need to solve the original issue of instead of
manually rotating the cylinder it needs to be rotated originally so I can work on the same 'surface'.
