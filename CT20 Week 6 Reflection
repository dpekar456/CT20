Hello! I decided what my second project is going to be, i was a little indecisive in what project I wanted to
start first, either the project from code of creaitve medium or the recreating other media. I decided that 
I want to do one of the color projects from the book because color is an interest of mine. Im going to do 
constructing a gradient. I decided to do this because it helps me evolve certain aspects of coding I have 
already learned how to do. Using map function and new ones like lerp color to create a smooth blend. i'm at
the start of the project but I think this will be a quicker one. I want to put a lot of focus onto my final 
project. in this project Im going to use p5.js but in my final project I want to use the HTML side of things.
