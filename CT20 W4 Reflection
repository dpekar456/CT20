Ok so I started over with my code, i kept running into the same problems so I decided resetting might be best. I decided to do I deeper dive into more basic coding because
I feel like I lack the knowledge to achieve what I want. I also learned different functions like map. part of which I asked my boyfriend for some assistence because 
he has some experience coding. I took some time but I really wanted to achieve my vision but it somewhat evolved somewhere along the way. I saw some interesting changes
but unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to change the background to my png but I couldn't figure it out in time.
